# opensolid/mesh

This package allows you to create and manipulate indexed triangular meshes,
especially useful for 3D rendering. Although it is used by other OpenSolid
packages such as [`opensolid/geometry`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/opensolid/geometry/latest),
this package is itself generic and works equally well with any vertex type.

## Installation

Assuming you have [installed Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) and
started a new project, use [elm-package](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html#elm-package)
to install `opensolid/mesh`, either by running

```
elm package install opensolid/mesh
```

in a command prompt inside your project directory or by adding

```json
"opensolid/mesh": "1.0.1 <= v < 2.0.0"
```

to the `dependencies` field in your project's `elm-package.json`.

## Documentation

[Full API documentation](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/opensolid/mesh/1.0.1/OpenSolid-Mesh)
is available.
