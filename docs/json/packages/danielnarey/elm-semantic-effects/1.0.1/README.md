# elm-semantic-effects: Make things happen on the user side of a web application

This package is a companion to *danielnarey/elm-semantic-dom* that includes the
functionality of core packages *elm-lang/dom* and *elm-lang/navigation*. I
created it primarily to avoid a name conflict over `Dom` between my package and
the core package. However, it also extends my semantic naming scheme to
functions for managing effects. Plus, it extends my pipeline approach for
setting up an Elm program to programs with location routing.
