# elm-semantic-dom: Syntactic sugar for cooking with Elm VirtualDom

### Why?

1. The code you use to generate your Elm program's view doesn't need to look
like HTML or SVG markup.
2. The functions in *elm-lang/html* and *elm-lang/svg* are just wrappers for
`VirtualDom` functions.
3. There's no reason why you shouldn't build abstractions for view components
directly on top of `VirtualDom` â€” it gives you more flexibility.
4. Because `VirtualDom` is intended for advanced use and customization, it's a
bare-bones package without helpers that would make it's functionality easier to
manipulate.
5. So: I created a set of helper functions for working with `VirtualDom` and put
them all in one package with semantically structured modules.
6. The package is intended as an infrastructure for building higher level
abstractions on top of `VirtualDom`, without the need to import `Html` or `Svg`.
7. All functions in this package are designed to be used in the "pipeline"
style, where data flows through a series of functions in an easily readable way,
from top to bottom and left to right.
8. Functions are also written to avoid unused arguments, with additional
"custom" functions available for rarely-used cases.
9. The idea behind my semantic naming schema is that the module name should
always be used when invoking a function; it improves the readability and
maintainability of Elm code, and you will never have to resolve errors due to
conflicting function names from imported modules. So, when you import a module
from this package, I recommend that you don't expose any function names. Then
you can use `Dom.Element.container` and `Dom.Keyed.container` in the same module
without overthinking it.
10. I am aware that module naming scheme I chose conflicts with *elm-lang/dom*,
which could be a problem but doesn't have to be. To avoid a compiler error when
there is a need to manage DOM effects, I created
*danielnarey/elm-semantic-effects* to wrap *elm-lang/dom*. When the two "dom"
are not both listed as imports in the `elm-package.json` file, there is no
compiler error, even if both packages are dependencies.
11. Constructive suggestions are welcome!
