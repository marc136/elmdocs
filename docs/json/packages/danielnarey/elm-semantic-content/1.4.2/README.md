This package was an experiment to design a set of constructor functions to
generate basic HTML content. Parts of the API have been incorporated into my
[Modular UI](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/danielnarey/elm-modular-ui/latest)
package, with some improvements that I think make the constructors more
intuitive to use.

In this package, I also tried out the idea of using Elm types to differentiate
categories of HTML content. This idea was abandoned in the Modular UI
implementation because it proved not to have any practical benefit.
