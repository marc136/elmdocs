This package was an experiment to represent Bulma CSS classes as a large nested
record set in Elm. It proved to be difficult to maintain due to ongoing
feature updates to the Bulma framework. In my opinion, the most useful aspect of
this package was the ability to look up available modifier classes using the Elm
REPL. However, this in itself was not enough of a reason to keep the package up
to date. Additionally, I have incorporated Bulma element classes into my UI
development framework for Elm,
[Modular UI](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/danielnarey/elm-modular-ui/latest),
and I am working on a companion package with constructors for Bulma components.
