# Experimental: html-typed

An experiment in creating an alternative to elm-lang/html that allows you to type your views.
The core idea here is to allow the semantic structure of the page to be expressed using a type.
Using this library it is then possible to write view functions that are guaranteed, at compile time, to match this type.

The API of this library is still in flux and the documentation is mostly missing. There's some examples in the `/examples` directory that give some idea about how to use this.
